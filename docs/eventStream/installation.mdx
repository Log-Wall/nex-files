## Startup

eventStream is a self-updating package. After installing the nxs file in Nexus eventStream will automatically download and install the latest version from NPM.

No other action is required by the User after installation. EventStream will automatically load each time a user logs in.

:::note
There is an `es load` alias provided in the package. That alias is primarily used for recovery and debugging. The alias is not needed for normal operation.
