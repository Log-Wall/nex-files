  fullName: "Warp",
  firstPerson:
    /^You reach out and clench a fist before (?<target>.+?), who screams and doubles over in agony as \w+ skin suddenly bubbles with gangrenous growths\.$/,
  secondPerson:
    /^(?<user>\w+) reaches out and clenches a fist before you\. You scream and double over in agony as your skin bubbles with gangrenous growths\.$/,
  thirdPerson:
    /^(?<user>\w+) reaches out and clenches a fist before (?<target>.+?), who screams and doubles over in agony as \w+ skin suddenly bubbles with gangrenous growths\.$/,
  profession: ["occultist"],
  skill: "occultism",
  balance: "equilibrium",
